# Using CNNs and Transfer Learning to Detect Pneumonia in Chest X-rays

This project aims to address the challenge of detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images through the application of Convolutional Neural Net- works (CNNs) and transfer learning. Leveraging TensorFlow for model im- plementation, we explore various transfer learning models and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize CNN performance.
