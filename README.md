# Using CNNs and Transfer Learning to Detect Pneumonia in Chest X-rays

This project aims to address the challenge of detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images through the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. Leveraging TensorFlow for model implementation, this work explores various transfer learning models and perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize CNN performance.
